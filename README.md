# EntitasTemplates
This project is based on Entitas

# How to use
Put 'EntitasUnityTemplates' .cs and folder into Asset/Entitas/Editor
den you can create few classes in Project Tab easily.

# TODO
1. I didn't test it on Mac yet.
2. If Entitas folder is not on Asset folder cs file needs to be modified( File path )
